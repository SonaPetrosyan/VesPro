    Each employee who enters the program has the following features:

       - restaurant number: <Restaurant>

       - hall number: <Holl>

       and powers:

          — order taker: <orderer> + workplace: <workplace> (is a number - workplace number)
            if these fields are checked, that employee can take an order

          — previous order taker: <previous> + workplace: <workplace>
            if these fields are checked, that employee can take a pre-order

          — manager: <manager>
            if this field is checked, that peer has the right to edit anywhere
            including this table
 
          — editor: <editor>
            if this field is checked, that peer has the right to edit anywhere
            this table is not among them.

          — observer: <observer>
            if only this field is marked, then that associate has the right to observe only.
            cannot be edited

        If the employee does not have any of these features, he cannot enter the program.


        These permissions are set with the <employees> button
  

        Everyone can have different combinations of these qualities.
  
 
         The printers needed to print the order and receipts are determined by the workplace.
  
         The meaning of the rest of the fields is as follows:

         <Password>: Password
         <Passqart>: password on magnetic media
         <Position>: The position
         <Name>: Name of the employee
