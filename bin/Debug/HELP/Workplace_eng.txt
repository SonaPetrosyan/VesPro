           workplace.

           This is indicated by the <Co workers> button.

           Different waiters may have the same workplace.

           The workplace determines which printer corresponds to his
           number for this workplace.

           (Each dish in <Menu> is assigned a printer number,
            which determines where the receipt for ordering this dish will be printed:
            kitchen, bar, barbecue, etc.)

            The printer is installed as follows:

            Double-click the <printer n> cell. Will open
            a list of printers from which to select a printer.

            If the printers <print>, <preprint>, <cash printer> are installed,
            then the corresponding buttons will appear on the waiterâ€™s screen
            otherwise these buttons are missing.

            If after making changes you did not click the <Save> button, then
            what you do will have no consequences.

           Click the yellow <X> button to close the window.
